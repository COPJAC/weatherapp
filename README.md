This Python code fetches weather information for a city from Google using web scraping. First, it asks the user for a city name. 
Then, it creates a search query for the weather in that city and forms a Google search URL. The code sends an HTTP request to this URL and retrieves the HTML response. 
Using BeautifulSoup, it parses the HTML to find the weather update, which is displayed to the user. 
Essentially, it fetches and displays the current weather information for the entered city.
